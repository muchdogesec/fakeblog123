# fakeblog123

We use this repository to host a blog we use to test our other tools [history4feed](https://github.com/muchdogesec/history4feed) and [Obstracts](https://github.com/muchdogesec/obstracts).

Unless you're helping to develop these products, this repo is likely of no use.

Incase it is, the critical details...

* The blog is built and hosted on Github pages (`main` branch)
* You can access the blog here:
* The RSS feed URL is here:
* If you need to add a new post, put it in `_posts` following the template of existing content

To run locally;

```shell
git clone https://github.com/muchdogesec/fakeblog123
cd fakeblog123
gem install bundler jekyll
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
